# Hello-World

My name is Dakota and I am early on in my journey to learn how to code. I hope to learn full-stack development (I am unsure if web development or apple/android app development at the moment; my initial "big project" idea for my portfolio could work for either. I am sure that as I develop my skills and ideas that I will start gearing toward a more specific set of skills. Until then, I figure that learning the basics of coding will be very similar, except for the different syntaxes for each language. Here's to an exciting (and probably sometimes boring, painful, but rewarding) journey! Many Cheers!

P.S. Just seeing how this addition and subtraction of items really workss.
